## Key goals

- Generate purpose-built buildings
- Have silly, interesting purposes
- Use ridiculous infrastructure

## At length

Most buildings end up being boring office buildings.  While 'form follows
function' is a thing, and many buildings are designed to suit the corporate
hierarchies of the funding organizations, there is an inherent homogeneity.
This does not provide us with meaningful constraints for layout algorithms, and
the result is not exceedingly interesting because it is hard to become
interested in a madlibs style algorithmically generated corporate structure.

We can get interesting layout constraints by having purposes that do not
remotely make sense in an office building, but are interesting.  For example,
the manufacture and assembly of airplanes in a downtown office building makes no
sense in the real world, but results in a building that requires huge open
spaces.  Misplaced manufacturing is perhaps a good strategy if only because
manufacturing different things at least provides different visuals, even if we
are otherwise constantly rehashing the same idea of manufacturing.

Ridiculous infrastructure, for example, means fulfilling my dream of an office
building with a log-flume based transportation system.  Rollercoasters,
ziplines, (people) cannons, trampolines, giant slides, geysers, climbing walls,
penumatic canisters, moving walkways, giant escalators, parachutes (after
somehow being flung upwards), chairlifts/skiing,
tunnels-through-massive-gelatin-blobs, submersibles inside water-filled areas,
hot air balloons, electrostatic repulsion, elephants/donkeys/pterodactyls, and
what not.  All of these things are absurd and can potentially influence building
design considerations in interesting ways.  Combine this with a city with the
potential to use similar or more absurd means of mass transit, and we have the
potential for buildings that are hopefully emergently interesting.
